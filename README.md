### Decoding of an Alien Signal sort of a Christmas bit of fun
You should try it without looking at the code first<br>
specgram(x);
The signal is in the wave file unknown.wav<br>
There is an Octave Matlab alien.m this should help you.<br>
i can't be bothered to do all that stuff then see simple.txt<br>
